# Machine-Learning-Exercises

A collection of ML algorithms that I implemented from scratch in Python. 
The goal is to familiarize myself with the algorithms, rather than to implement them as efficiently or elegantly as possible.

The 'hw' folders contain assignments for the ColumbiaX Machine Learning course.

# hw3
hw3 implements two different clustering algorithms: K-means and Expectation-Maximization for Gaussian Mixture Models.
The data set X.csv is the Wine data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
