Evaluated the algorithms on the MNIST dataset.

First used PCA feature reduction, followed by Naive Bayes implemented by hand. After selecting the optimal number of
principal components (16) and train/test data (5000), obtained 73% accuracy.

Then used sklean's LDA for feature reduction and classification. After selecting the optimal number of
principal components (16) and train/test data (5000), obtained 84% accuracy.
